# 🏥 Hospital Emergency Room Analysis (Excel Dashboard)

This project presents an **interactive Excel dashboard** built to analyze and visualize key aspects of Emergency Room (ER) operations using real-world hospital data. It focuses on understanding patient inflow, wait times, satisfaction levels, and referral patterns to drive meaningful, data-backed decisions.

---

## 📊 Dashboard Goals

- Monitor daily patient inflow and wait time trends  
- Track patient satisfaction fluctuations  
- Identify peak congestion periods and staffing gaps  
- Analyze referral departments and admission patterns  
- Enhance triage planning and service delivery

---

## 📅 Dataset Overview

- **Records:** 9,216 patient entries  
- **Timeline:** April 1, 2023 – October 30, 2024  
- **Key Fields:**  
  - Patient ID, Gender, Age, Race  
  - Admission Date & Time  
  - Department Referral, Wait Time, Satisfaction Score  
  - Admission Status

---

## 🧩 Data Enhancements (Power Pivot)

- **Age Grouping**: Patients bucketed into 10-year age bands  
- **Attend Status**: “On Time” vs. “Delayed” using 30-min threshold  
- **Calendar Table**: Created from Admission Date for dynamic filtering  

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- **Total Patients**: 9,216 
- **Average Wait Time**: 35.26 minutes  
- **Avg. Satisfaction Score**: 4.99 / 10  
- **Admission Rate**: ~50%  
- **Most Referred Dept**: General Practice  
- **High Inflow Age Groups**: 20–39 years  
- **59% patients delayed** — highlights service lag during peak hours

---

## 💡 Recommendations

- Allocate extra staff during peak traffic hours  
- Introduce real-time wait time display for patients  
- Collect quick feedback at discharge to fix bottlenecks early  
- Speed up triage for patients aged 20–39  
- Streamline protocols for high-referral departments like GP and Ortho
